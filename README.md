# react-dead-components

Searches a directory for react components that appear to be unused in any other components, 
left behind on the battlefield by some uncaring soul.

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Installation

#### TODO

## Usage

```bash

reactdc src/

```

## TODO 

* Add depth limiter
* Better support for crappy component definitions
* Detect ones that are used less than X times
* Optimize this because it probably sucks
* Put on NPM

## Disclaimer
Completely terrible repo, will have virtually no time put into it, use at your own risk
